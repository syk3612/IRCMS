# IRCMS
This project simulates an automated railway crossing management system using PL/SQL. When a train approaches a gate, the system senses the status and closes the gate. Once the train passes, the system automatically opens the gate.  The system also maintains a history log of all actions (OPEN/CLOSED) with timestamps.
